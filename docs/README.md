# Scrapy Cluster Documentation

Follow [this](http://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html#in-rst) guide on readthedocs to get your own local documentation up and running

Once you have everything set up, just remember to use

```bash
$ sphinx-autobuild . _build_html

Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000
...
```

to view the documentation as you live edit it on your machine. Note that the `default` theme is overridden by readthedocs when uploading, so don't mind that the local documentation is different from what you see online.
