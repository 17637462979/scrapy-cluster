Scrapy cannot have a project with ‘-‘ in it, therefore we need to make a generic ‘crawling’ project underneath the versioned folder.

To run the crawler offline test:
/opt/miniconda/bin/python tests/tests_offline.py -v

To run the crawler online test:
/opt/miniconda/bin/python tests/tests_online.py -r <redis-server>
